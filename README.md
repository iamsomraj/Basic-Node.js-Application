# Basic Node.js Application
Basic Node.js Application is a repository on Node.js . This is my first time using Node.js. I have used Node.js , Express.js and Ejs in this repo.

## Objectives

1. Writing and reading files
2. Using Node.js to take input from form and display in DOM
3. Using Express.js to do the same
4. Using Ejs to render dynamically
